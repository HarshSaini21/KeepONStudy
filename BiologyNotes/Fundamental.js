        <Text>
          Life, as we know it, took billions of years to evolve. From the very
          first precursor of life to the multitude of multicellular organisms
          that we see around us today, the most basic unit of all these is the
          cell.

          All About Cells Cells are the basic structural and functional unit of
          life. Cell was discovered by Robert Hooke. A number of cells can work
          together to form tissues and organs.

          Cellular respiration Cellular respiration is the process by which the
          food releases energy in the mitochondria. Cells absorb glucose from
          the food and burn it to produce energy.

          Prokaryotic & Eukaryotic cells Two types of cell; Prokaryotic and
          Eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are primitive and lack well
          defined nucleus. Eukaryotic cells are more advanced and have well
          defined nucleus.

          Cell structure in Eukaryotic cells Eukaryotic cells have the most well
          defined structure. These cells have cell membrane, membrane bound cell
          organelles and a well defined nucleus. The nucleus has its own
          membrane called nuclear membrane. Cell membrane • The cell membrane is
          the outer covering of a cell. • It is made up of phospholipid bilayer
          membrane. • It is selectively permeable in nature. • The structure of
          a cell membrane is best described by the fluid mosaic model.

        <Text>Diffusion</Text>
        <Text>
          The movement of molecules from a region of their high concentration to
          a region of their lower concentration is known as diffusion. E.g.
          carbon dioxide and oxygen move across the cell membrane by diffusion
        </Text>

          Osmosis in selectively permeable membrane Osmosis is the movement of
          water across a semi-permeable membrane. Osmosis is a selective process
          since the membrane does not allow all molecules to pass through it.
          Water is usually the only free flowing molecule across this membrane.

          Isotonic, hypotonic solutions, hypertonic solutions • Isotonic
          solutions are those which have the same solute and pH concentration as
          the surrounding body fluid or the cytoplasm. • Hypotonic solutions
          contain lesser amount of solute concentration compared to the
          surrounding fluid and can force the cell to rupture due to excess
          input of water into the cell. • Hypertonic solutions contain a higher
          concentration of solute compared to the surrounding fluid and thus
          push water out of the cell, shrinking it.

          Cell walls in plants Plant cells are different from animal cells due
          to the presence of a cell wall. The cell wall is made of cellulose and
          gives a rigid structure to the plant cell. It provides structural
          support to plants. Due to cell walls, cells of plants, fungi and
          bacteria can withstand greater changes in surrounding conditions than
          animal cells. E.g. Cell wall enables the cells to withstand hypotonic
          solution without bursting.

          Endocytosis Endocytosis is the invagination of the cell membrane,
          followed by pinching off forming a membranebound vesicle. This is
          commonly seen in Amoeba.

          Nucleus in cells The nucleus is the processing unit of the cell. It is
          a double membrane-bound organelle which contains the genetic material
          for inheritance. The nuclear membrane contains pores that allow the
          transfer of materials from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The nucleus
          is the brain of the cell as it controls various functions such as cell
          division, reproduction, inheritance, etc. The nucleus contains genetic
          material, i.e. chromosomes that contain DNA. DNA carry information for
          inheritance from parents to offspring. Prokaryotes lack a well-defined
          nucleus and the genetic material is present in a region known as the
          nucleoid.

        <Text>
          Chromosomes Chromosomes are the genetic material present in the
          nucleus. It contains DNA with associated proteins. They are present as
          threads called chromatin. During the growth phase of the cell, the
          chromatin condenses into a much thicker structure called a chromosome.
          Human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes (46)
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Chromatin Chromatin is a thread-like structure which serves as the
          genetic material present inside the nucleus of the cell. It is made up
          of DNA and protein molecules. DNA contains the hereditary information
          needed for the structure and function of the organism.

          Cytoplasm The cytoplasm is the fluid found inside the cell. It gives
          the structure to the cell and houses different organelles of the cell.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Organelles Organelles are structures present in the cytoplasm of the
          cell that helps in several functions of the cell.

          Endoplasmic Reticulum The endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane-bound
          cell organelle that plays an integral role in the interpretation of
          the genetic information present in the nucleus.

          Rough ER Rough ER are the ones that have ribosomes on them. The
          ribosome is made up of nucleic acids and proteins. They are the site
          of protein synthesis. The Rough ER is also involved in the
          modification and folding of proteins.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Smooth ER Smooth ER do not have ribosomes and thus are not involved in
          protein synthesis. They are, however, involved in lipid metabolism and
          detoxifying of poisonous molecules.

          Golgi Apparatus Golgi Apparatus is also called the post office of the
          cell. They package and transport the proteins across the cytoplasm.

          Lysosomes They are referred to as suicide bags of the cell as they
          contain potent enzymes that can digest a cell. Lysosomes also help in
          defence by attacking a foreign object.

          Mitochondria Mitochondria are also called the powerhouse of a cell.
          They generate ATP via the electron transport chain. They also have a
          DNA called mtDNA, which makes them a semi-autonomous organelle.
          Mitochondria can make their own proteins.

          Plastids There are various types of plastids in different cells based
          on the pigment they contain. The chloroplast is the plastid where
          photosynthesis occurs, they contain chlorophyll. Some of the other
          plastids are leucoplast and chromoplast. Leucoplasts store starch, oil
          and protein granules. Chloroplasts contain membranes known as
          thylakoids embedded in the stroma. Plastids also contain their own DNA
          and ribosomes.

          Vacuoles Vacuoles are large vesicles that hold water or air in them
          and give structural rigidity to the cell. Vacuoles are common in plant
          cells. In animals, the vacuoles are either very small or absent.
        </Text>

          Comparison between plant & animal cells Plants cells are different
          from animal cells structurally. Plant cells have cell walls and
          chloroplast which are missing in animal cells. Plants cells also have
          large vacuoles which are either very small or missing in animal cells.
          The nucleus is present at the centre of the cell in animal cells and
          at the periphery in plant cells
