          Anything that has mass and takes up space is referred to as matter.
          hydrogen and oxygen, sugar and sand, air and water, etc. Small,
          minuscule particles make up matter. Due to the space between them,
          matter particles are attracted to one another. States of Matter •
          Matter can be classified as solid, liquid and gas on the basis of
          interparticle forces and the arrangement of particles. • These three
          forms of matter are interconvertible by increasing or decreasing
          pressure and temperature. For example, ice can be converted from solid
          to a liquid by increasing the temperature. Property Solid Shape and
          volume Fixed shape and volume Liquid No fixed shape but has volume Gas

          Physical Nature of Matter • A physical property is that aspect of the
          matter that can be observed or measured without changing its nature or
          composition. • It is independent of the amount of matter present. •
          Physical properties include appearance, colour, odour, density,
          texture, melting point, boiling point, solubility, etc.
          Characteristics of Particles of Matter Matter Matter is anything that
          has mass and occupies space. • Everything that we can touch, see,
          hear, taste and also smell is matter. • It is made up of really tiny
          particles which cannot be seen through the eye. The particles of which
          the matter is comprised influence its state and properties (physical
          and chemical). 1. Particles of matter have spaces between them • This
          characteristic is one of the concepts behind the solubility of a
          substance in other substances. For example, on dissolving sugar in
          water, there is no rise in water level because the particles of sugar
          get into the interparticle spaces between the water particles. 2.
          Particles of matter are always in motion • Particles of the matter
          show continuous random movements due to the kinetic energy they
          possess. • A rise in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the
          particles, making them move more vigorously. 3. Particles of matter
          attract each other In every substance, there is an interparticle force
          of attraction acting between the particles. To break a substance we
          need to overcome this force. The strength of the force differs from
          one substance to another.

          Diffusion When the particles of matter intermix on their own with each
          other, the phenomenon is called diffusion. For example, spreading of
          ink in water. • During diffusion, the particles occupy the
          interparticle spaces. • The rate of diffusion increases with increase
          in the temperature, due to increase in kinetic energy of the
          particles.

        <Text>Can Matter Change Its State?</Text>

          Effect of change of temperature on state of matter On increasing
          temperature, the kinetic energy of the particles of the matter
          increases and they begin to vibrate with a higher energy. Therefore,
          the interparticle force of attraction between the particles reduces
          and particles get detached from their position and begin to move
          freely. • As a result, the state of matter begins to change. • Solids
          undergo a phase change to form liquids. • Similarly, liquids also
          undergo a phase change to form gases. Melting point The melting point
          of a solid is defined as the temperature at which solid melts to
          become liquid at the atmospheric pressure. • At melting point, these
          two phases, i.e., solid and liquid are in equilibrium, i.e., at this
          point both solid state and liquid state exist simultaneously. Fusion
          When two atoms collide to create a heavier atom, such as when two
          hydrogen atoms combine to create one helium atom, this process is
          known as fusion. This process generates enormous amounts of energy,
          many times more than fission, and powers the sun. Furthermore, it
          doesn’t generate radioactive fission products. The melting point at
          which ice a solid turns to water a liquid is 32°F (0°C). Boiling point
          The boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which
          the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric
          pressure. The boiling point for any material is the temperature point
          at which the material transforms into the gas phase in the liquid
          phase. This happens at 100 degrees centigrade for water. The Celsius
          scale was in fact created on the basis of the ice/water melting point
          and the liquid water/vapor boiling point. Latent heat of fusion It is
          the amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid
          into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point. Latent heat
          of vaporisation It is the amount of heat energy that is required to
          change 1 kg of a liquid into gas at atmospheric pressure at its
          boiling point. Sublimation The transition of a substance directly from
          its solid phase to gaseous phase without changing into the liquid
          phase (or vice versa) is called sublimation.

          Effect of change in pressure on state of matter By applying pressure,
          the interparticle spaces between particles of matter decreases. Thus,
          by applying pressure and reducing temperature we can convert a solid
          to liquid and a liquid to gas.

          Evaporation The phenomenon by which molecules in liquid state undergo
          a spontaneous transition to the gaseous phase at any temperature below
          its boiling point is called evaporation. • For example, the gradual
          drying of damp clothes is caused by the evaporation of water to water
          vapour. Factors affecting evaporation • Temperature: The rate of
          evaporation increases with an increase in temperature. • Surface area:
          The rate of evaporation increases with an increase in surface area. •
          Humidity: The rate of evaporation decreases with an increase in
          humidity. • Wind speed: The rate of evaporation increases with an
          increase in wind speed. Cooling due to evaporation During evaporation,
          the particles of a liquid absorb energy from the surroundings to
          overcome the interparticle forces of attraction and undergo the phase
          change. The absorption of heat from the surrounding makes the
          surrounding cool. For example, sweating cools down our body.
          Applications of Evaporative Cooling • To keep water cool, it is kept
          in earthenware containers. Similar to the pores in cotton fabric, the
          pores in the earthen pot’s surface area allow for more evaporation. •
          To keep our body cool, we sweat a lot. Evaporation is what
          transpiration ultimately is. Our body’s water evaporates, using energy
          in the process and lowering our body temperature as a result. • We
          dress in cotton during the summer. Since cotton is a powerful water
          absorbent, it allows more perspiration to come into touch with the
          air, promoting more evaporation. We have a cooling effect when wearing
          cotton clothing because of this.
